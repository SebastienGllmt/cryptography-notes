# Cryptography notes

Notes from my own personal studies on cryptography, built with Figma

This folder has two sections:
- `explanations`: higher-level constructed explainers on topics
- `theory`: specific building blocks used to create explanations (the same theory may appear in multiple different explanations)

Note on file format:
- `svg` is good for checking diffs, but it's harder to use because text is not preserved (it's convereted into paths)
- `pdf` is easier to read and distribute, but hard to diff (and therefore only shared for explainers)
